# [CVPR 2020] Single-Image HDR Reconstruction by Learning to Reverse the Camera Pipeline

<img src='./teaser.png' width=1000>

Recovering a high dynamic range (HDR) image from asingle low dynamic range (LDR) input image is challenging due to missing details in under-/over-exposed regions caused by quantization and saturation of camera sensors. In contrast to existing learning-based methods, our core idea is to incorporate the domain knowledge of the LDR image formation pipeline into our model. We model the HDR-to-LDR image formation pipeline as the (1) dynamic range clipping, (2) non-linear mapping from a camera response function, and (3) quantization. We then propose to learn three specialized CNNs to reverse these steps. By decomposing the problem into specific sub-tasks, we impose effective physical constraints to facilitate the training of individual sub-networks. Finally, we jointly fine-tune the entire model end-to-end to reduce error accumulation. With extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on diverse image datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art single-image HDR reconstruction algorithms. The source code, datasets, and pre-trained model are available at our project website.

## Requirements setup
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

    * tested using TensorFlow 1.10.0

* To download the pre-trained models:

    * [ckpt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e9vP8YPEjGcvXCa0Bfqwxw7qks7dH-VE/view?usp=sharing)

## Usage
* Run your own images (using the model trained on our synthetic training data):
``` bash
CUDA_VISIBLEDEVICES=0 python3 test_real.py --ckpt_path_deq ckpt_deq/model.ckpt --ckpt_path_lin ckpt_lin/model.ckpt --ckpt_path_hal ckpt_hal/model.ckpt --test_imgs ./imgs --output_path output_hdrs
```

* Run your own images (using the model fine-tuned on both synthetic and real training data):
``` bash
CUDA_VISIBLEDEVICES=0 python3 test_real_refinement.py --ckpt_path ckpt_deq_lin_hal_ref/model.ckpt --test_imgs ./imgs --output_path output_hdrs
